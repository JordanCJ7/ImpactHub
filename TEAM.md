# ImpactHub: Team Roles & Sprint Responsibilities

> Clear accountability across roles in a 5-sprint Agile project

This document outlines the **roles and responsibilities** of each team member throughout the 5-sprint development of **ImpactHub**, a charity donation platform. The team follows **Scrum methodology**, with defined roles:

- **Product Owner (PO):** Janitha Gamage  
- **Scrum Master (SM):** Dewmini Navodya
